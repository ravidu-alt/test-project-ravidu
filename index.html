        <h2><b>Covid-19 is now ubiquitous â€“ but hospitalisations seem to be on a downward trajectory. No one knows why.</b></h2> 
        <p>
            When virologists took their first peek at XEC, the Covid-19 variant which 
            <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2827145#:~:text=XEC%2C%20the%20up%2Dand%2D,1%20and%20KP.">
            started to become dominant in the autumn of 2024</a> , 
            the early signs were ominous.
        </p> 

        <p>
            The latest descendant of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, XEC had <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract
            /2827145#:~:text=XEC%2C%20the%20up%2Dand%2D,1%20and%20KP.">arisen through recombination</a>, a process where two other variants had 
            forged their genetic material together. <br> Tests seemed to indicate that this would easily allow it to evade the immune protection offered 
            by past infections or the latest iterations of the Covid-19 vaccines, based on the older JN.1 and KP.2 variants.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b> "The spike protein is quite different from previous variants, so it was quite easy to assume that XEC has the potential to evade 
            immunity induced by JN.1 infection,"</b>
            says Kei Sato, a virology professor at the University of Tokyo, who carried out one of the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/
            article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00731-X/fulltext">first studies</a> of XEC, published in December 2024.

        <p>
            In the US, infectious disease specialists braced themselves for an immediate surge in hospitalisations in the wake 
            of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. But it didn't happen. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-currentlevels.html">Surveillance 
            testing</a> carried out by measuring Covid in wastewater samples across major cities indicated that XEC was definitely infecting people. 
            However, the numbers of people actually ending up in hospital was considerably less than previous winters. According to 
            <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#covidnet-hospitalization-network">CDC data</a> , the rate of hospitalisations at the 
            start of Dec 2023 was 6.1 per 100,000 people. During the equivalent week in December 2024, that had fallen to two per 100,000 people.
        </p>

        <h1>What was going on?</h1>
        <p>
            "Right now, we're seeing pretty low levels of people who are critically ill, even though there's an astronomical amount of 
            Covid in wastewater," says Peter Chin-Hong, a professor in the Health Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of 
            California, San Francisco. "It just shows that regardless of how scary a variant might look in the lab, the environment 
            in which it lands is much more inhospitable."
